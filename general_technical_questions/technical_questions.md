## Technical Questions

### How do you find the max depth of a binary tree?
### What is the most challenging algorithm you created?
### What steps do you take when learning a new programming language?
### Say you are creating a game of tic tac toe, how would you create an algorithm to implement a computer's artificial intelligence for the game?
### How well would you rate you know C++
### What do you test for given that there isn't enough time to test everything you want to?
### Give me a quick algorithm on how you can shuffle a deck of cards?
### How do you improve your programming skills in your own time?
W### hat’s the most extensive program you’ve written?
